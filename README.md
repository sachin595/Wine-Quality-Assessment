# Wine-Quality-Assessment
## The Original Data:
Wine makers from Portugal studied many types of wine both quantitatively and qualitatively. For each wine they measured 11 numerical chemical attributes (e.g., chlorides, density, pH value) and they asked 3 or more “experts” to assign a “quality value” (0 to 10), recording the median score from the experts.
The data is originally provided by the Machine Learning Repository of the University of California - Irvine (UCI) in 2 “Comma-Separated Values” (CSV) files:
winequality-red.csv ….. (4898 red wines)
